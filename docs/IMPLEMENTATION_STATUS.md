   - Full-screen card interface replacing modal
   - Visual feedback during swipes
   - Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys + escape)
   - Fluid responsive design with flexbox
   - Consistent image aspect ratios (300px height)
   - Viewport-constrained (85vh max)

4. **Updated AppContext** (`src/context/AppContext.tsx`)

   - Added swipe state management
   - showSwipeableCard, hideSwipeableCard, handleSwipe functions
   - Swipe statistics tracking

5. **Updated ParticipantCard** (`src/components/ParticipantCard.tsx`)

   - Now opens swipeable card instead of modal
   - Maintains existing accessibility features

6. **CSS Styles** (`src/app/globals.css`)
   - Complete styling for swipeable cards
   - Visual feedback animations
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Fluid layouts with no fixed heights
   - Mobile-first approach

### âœ… Features Implemented

- **Swipe Gestures**: Left (dislike), Right (like) only
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded borders and shadows during swipes
- **Keyboard Support**: Arrow keys for navigation, Escape to close
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, focus management, ARIA labels
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Touch & Mouse**: Supports both touch and mouse interactions
- **Smooth Animations**: Card transforms and transitions
- **Mobile Optimization**: iOS scrolling support, gesture conflict resolution

### ðŸ”„ Current Behavior

- Clicking a participant card opens the swipeable interface
- Users can swipe left/right or use keyboard navigation
- Swipe actions are logged to console (backend integration pending)
- Card closes after swipe action or overlay click
- Content is fully scrollable on mobile and desktop
- Maintains all existing functionality

## Phase 2: Backend Integration ðŸš§ PENDING

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **API Routes**

   - Create `/api/swipes` POST endpoint
   - Create `/api/swipes/[participantId]` GET endpoint
   - Implement session management
   - Add data validation

2. **Database Setup**

   - Design swipe table schema
   - Set up database connection
   - Create statistics views

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Store swipe results
   - Retrieve swipe statistics
   - Handle user sessions

## Phase 3: Dynamic Display ðŸš§ PENDING

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Features

1. **Statistics Display**

   - Show swipe counts on participant cards
   - Real-time updates
   - Visual indicators for popular participants

2. **Enhanced UX**
   - Swipe history view
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Performance optimizations

## Testing Status

### âœ… Manual Testing Completed

- Swipe gestures work on desktop (mouse)
- Keyboard navigation functional
- Visual feedback displays correctly
- Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- Accessibility features working

### ðŸš§ Pending Tests

- Touch gestures on mobile devices
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Cross-browser compatibility
- API integration testing

## Known Issues

1. **Gesture Detection**: May need fine-tuning of sensitivity on different devices
2. **Performance**: Large participant lists may need optimization
3. **Backend**: No actual data persistence yet (Phase 2)
